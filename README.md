# DSA Project: Social Network using Graph 
Our project aims to address the need for a dynamic and scalable social network graph system, similar to Instagram, that allows users to establish and maintain connections. The existing systems lack real-time capabilities and efficient expansion when new users are added to the network. We must tackle the challenge of managing user data, creating connections, and ensuring real-time updates for a seamless social experience.
